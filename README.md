## 🧠 About Me  
Hi there! I’m **Aniekan-Abasi Inyang** — a curious, community-driven **Computer Science student** passionate about building scalable tools that merge logic, creativity, and impact.  

I’m currently exploring **AI/ML, robotics, and systems programming**, with hands-on experience across web, backend, and data-intensive applications. From AI-powered IDE extensions to language learning assistants, I love solving hard problems and bringing ideas to life.  

As a **first-generation builder** 🇳🇬🇺🇸, I bring a global, innovative perspective to every project.

## 🚀 Projects  
Here are some of my favorite builds:  

### 🔹 [Auto-Doc](https://github.com/aniekanai/auto-doc)  
An **AI-powered VS Code extension + CLI tool** that auto-generates structured documentation for Python & ML workflows using GPT. Cuts documentation time by 40% and helps developers maintain clearer codebases.  

### 🔹 [Accent Learning Buddy](https://github.com/aniekanai/accent-learning-buddy)  
A **GenAI desktop app** that helps users improve spoken English accents.  
Built with Tkinter, OpenAI (GPT + Whisper), and Murf TTS for interactive, real-time feedback. Shortlisted for **Audience Choice Award** at Murf AI Hackathon.  

### 🔹 Fake News Detection (Break Through Tech AI x Accenture)  
NLP-powered system to detect misinformation using **Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and LSTMs** with custom trust scoring. Currently improving model precision/recall with TF-IDF features and hyperparameter tuning.  

🔜 **Triangle Vision Project (NVIDIA Jetson)** – Exploring robotics + generative AI for an upcoming showcase.
